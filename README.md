# threejs_game
Getting knowledge about Three.js inspired me to make easy-to-play car game. In this project I wanted to show my back-end skills from university and use them to created fully working product. Also I get familiar with creating 3D objects and animating them. Be careful on the road and earn as many points as you can! I'm warning you, this is really addictive!
